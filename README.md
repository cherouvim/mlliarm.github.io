# About

## Junior Software Developer @ InSyBio

Scientific programmer, using python, R, numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, ggplot2 for machine learning, data preprocessing, visualization and analysis. The problems we're being called to tackle at InSyBio include problems of classification and regression for biomedical data in the realm of big data using supervised & unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Finally, I'm holding a MSc in Computational Mathematics and Computational Intelligence from the Mathematics department of the University of Patras and a BSc in Physics from the University of Crete. My MSc thesis was on Active machine learning using JCLAL and Weka along with python to set up the experiment XML files.
