## Fractals
This is a simple showcase of how one can use R markdown documents with knitr.
You can find the project [here](http://mlliarm.github.io/fractals).

## Protoselida
This is a web-scraping project where I've built a tool that given a date it downloads
the frontpages of most Greek newspapers. It was written in Python3.
You can find the project [here](https://github.com/mlliarm/protoselida).

## The road network of Crete
This was a major undergraduate coursework for the course "Complex Networks" I took while I was at the Physics department.
In this study I had extracted the nodes and edges from an actual map of Crete and from there constructed the road network.
Then I calculated some centrality measures for the network and draw conclusions about which node was the most central one.
The project will be soon uploaded when it'll be converted to LaTeX. In the meantime here you can find the first version
written in Libreoffice and in Greek.
