## Particleslogic
The main idea is that it's a Prolog application with which you can find out if a given interaction between N and M particles, or if a decay of a particle to N particles is possible.

The converse should also be possible, given N input particles to get all the resulting possible output particles, but this function doesn't work well right now.

The mechanics behind it are the so called conservation laws of Physics. They are rules of conserved quantities, i.e. quantities that are being conserved during every elementary interaction. So, I've coded these laws as rules, and if all of them hold true, then an interaction is possible.

[Here](https://github.com/mlliarm/particleslogic) is the repository.

## Ia
A small [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic) library in [Logtalk](https://logtalk.org/). Find the repository [here](https://github.com/mlliarm/ia).

## The road network of Crete
This was a major undergraduate coursework for the course "Complex Networks" I took while I was at the Physics department.
In this study I had extracted the nodes and edges from an actual map of Crete and from there constructed the road network.
Then I calculated some centrality measures for the network and draw conclusions about which node was the most central one. Find the repository [here](https://github.com/mlliarm/the_road_network_of_crete).

## Mixmax-py
A research project in python and cython. In this project we successfully construct a python implementation of the two-parameter family of C-system operators A(N,s), as discussed in the paper of KSavvidy2016 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2016.05.003), [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06274)). We reproduced most of the paper's results. Find repository [here](https://github.com/mlliarm/mixmax-py).

## APL âˆŠ BCN
On 2021-11-30 the first APLjk community in Spain based in Barcelona was created, as a [meetup](https://meetup.com/apl-bcn).

For more information see [here](https://mlliarm.github.io/apl-in-bcn/) the website of the meetup and [here](https://aplwiki.com/index.php?title=APL_%E2%88%8A_BCN) some more information from the aplwiki page.

## Fractals
This is a simple showcase of how one can use R markdown documents with knitr.
You can find the project [here](http://mlliarm.github.io/fractals).

## Protoselida
This is a web-scraping project where I've built a tool that given a date it downloads
the frontpages of most Greek newspapers. It was written in Python3.
You can find the project [here](https://github.com/mlliarm/protoselida).
