# About

## Scientific programmer - Analyst

Independent professional in computational science. I use Python (Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib), Mathematica and C/C++11 for simulations and scientific calculations solving mathematical problems of a wide range, from differential equations to optimization.

I'm also interested in data analytics and the application of mathematical methods in the fields of machine learning, statistics and optimization using Python and R.

Finally, I'm holding a MSc in Computational Mathematics and Computational Intelligence from the Mathematics department of the University of Patras and a BSc in Physics. My MSc thesis was on Active machine learning using JCLAL and Weka.
