# Who

## Data Engineer @ Webhelp ES

- A physics graduate (BSc) with postgraduate studies in Computational Mathematics and A.I. (MSc). My MSc thesis was an emperic study on Active Machine learning (AML), using JCLAL library and python3. I hate it.

- I think that modern ML is just glorified stastistics applied on modern computer hardware.

- The theory ([eg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension), [eg'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning), [eg''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory)) although it's pretty nice, nobody seems to give a damn about it nowdays.
